Web-Based Social Stories Template Creator

Summary

A Social Stories Template Creator Website for Teachers to help children with Autism
Description

 Children who are autistic tend to have difficulty understanding social situations. Teachers create narrative “social stories” to teach children about social situations. For example, a story about going to the mall could help teach a student about proper behavior at a mall. Currently, when a student requires such a social story, teachers write up a quick paragraph on the fly and read the paragraph to the child.
Requirements

1.       Text editor that could efficiently template stories for re use. Think Mad-libs.
2.       Keep track of which story is told to which student.
